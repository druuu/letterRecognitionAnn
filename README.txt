Artificial Neural Networks being used. Core code is in octave which has been
taken from coursera.org machine learning course and modified.
The training data is set of fonts with different distortions.

1.run letRecGui.py musing python2.7
2.ex4.m is main file of neural nets which is called by letRecGui.m
3.fmicg is cost minimization function file
4.to train neural nets change maxiter in ex4.m file and comment
load('grads.mat') line
